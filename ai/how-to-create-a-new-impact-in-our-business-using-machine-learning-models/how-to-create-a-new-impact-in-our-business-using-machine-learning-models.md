## How to create a new impact in our business, using machine learning models?

In order to impact in our business using machine learning models, we should identify where we need
more optimization and speed.

Afterwards, we should review which machine learning model is more suitable for the situation.

We can make a huge difference between our normal process and the process that we want to build up.

These machine learning models can adjust to our problem and failures that we are currently passing by.

At the moment, we apply these models mentioned, then we can appreciate how these models speed up our process.

Because these models are already built to use variables and constants from our normal process. So, then we can get the same result in less time and effort.

In case, we want to run these models simultaneously, then we may even get more results and go ahead against other processes.
