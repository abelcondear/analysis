## Personalize and boost your sales using AI

In case, you want to use AI to personalize your sales, you may consider the following:

- Collect as much information from consumer.

- Analyze carefully and smart criteria from that collected information.

- Remove irrelevant information.

- Analyze again remaining information.

- Remove irrelevant information if it is needed. Or it could be separate it in another group.

- Create one strategy for each subset of information.

- Study carefully consumer behavior.

- Make a graph about consumer behavior for different period of time.

- Make a graph for each strategy created previously and review which strategy succeeded and which strategy did not.

- Compare graphs from same consumer for different period of time.

- Compare graphs from strategies with success versus strategies with no success.

- Eventually, after all these actions could be executed, then company sales could be boosted. However, this is not a guaranteed that your sales will raise, it will need to be adjusted over and over again until finding what company sees by itself the best way to personalize its sales in order to boost it much faster and successfully.
