## How would you find some text inside documents using AI programming?

- We can try to classify them in groups before starting the searching using AI programming. Then, we can search the specific text through out all documents.

- We can discard those documents which have nothing to do with our search by analyzing semantically the title and subtitle of documents.

- We can use threads in order to run simultaneously many AI processes that perform the searching. In this way, we shorten the time of processing these documents.
