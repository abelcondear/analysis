## How could you give more security to AI systems?

We can give more security using AI programming, following these steps:

- Add face recognition.
- Add finger-print recognition.
- Add eye recognition.
- Combine previous techniques recognition.
- Make data either encrypted or obfuscated during transfer between AI system and server.
- Make each AI task as one solid, unified, and atomic without leaving any AI task, unfinished or uncompleted so that no other unauthorized people cannot enter your system.
