## Have you ever optimized campaigns?

In order to optimize campaign we can consider these usual key metrics.

- Conversion rate. Users completed the desired or expected action by web app.

- Click-through rate. Numbers of times that user clicked same item.

- Bounce rate. Number or percentage that user landed either web app or web page, and leaved after viewing it.


### According to result of this metrics we can perform the following comparisons. ###

A. First campaign versus last one. Here, we should appreciate which relevant differences we can take into account to know what campaign-items or campaign-variables must change for the next campaign release.

B. Last campaign versus previous one. Here, we may likely appreciate few differences. However, these few ones may tell us about the missing campaign-variables and/or campaign-images (for example: an image that represents the campaign itself).

C. One campaign versus another one. Here, we could see according to each comparison of this kind what different differences may appear along every comparison performed. Then, we would be able to reach the conclusion about the campaign-variables which we should remove/modify/add new ones.


Finally, we can say that any comparison (not only campaigns comparisons) should be analyzed very carefully because some campaign-variables which were mentioned before, may lead us to false concepts or conclusion. We should remember that campaign-variables, which we might collect, are not usually reliable.
