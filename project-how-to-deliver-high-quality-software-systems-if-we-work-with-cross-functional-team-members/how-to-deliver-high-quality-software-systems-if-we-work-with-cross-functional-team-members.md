## How to deliver high-quality software systems if we work with cross-functional team members?

This task usually takes much work. It leads us to analyze different sides of the same product. 

This product analysis-kind should consist in the following:

+ Make sure every functionality is working as expected.
+ Review, if any product feature could be either discarded from the product release, or not.
+ Have meetings with teams’ members who were responsible to create and design the product.
	- During these meetings I suggest every team member may express his/her idea about what he/she has done to contribute with the product release.
	- Along these meetings I ask if any team member considers to reevaluate the release of product in order to assure possible inconsistencies as internal issues as external issues.
+ Analyze pros and cons about the product release.
+ Review, if the product is what the client is expecting. Or, even though, if the product is exceeding what the client is expecting.

At the end, I can decide more properly, if it is the right moment to release the product or if we need to wait for.
